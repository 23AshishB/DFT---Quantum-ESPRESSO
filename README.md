## DFT with Quantum ESPRESSO
This repository is dedicated to the study of the electronic properties of solids using Density Functional Theory (DFT), implemented through Quantum ESPRESSO. Key properties analyzed include:

* Band Structure
* Density of States (DOS)
* Optical Properties 
* Bulk Modulus
* Defect Formation Energy
Additionally, I have explored the antiferromagnetic behavior of Nickel Oxide (NiO) by incorporating magnetism and applying the Hubbard U correction. This provides a more accurate representation of the strongly correlated electrons in NiO.
