Collect the data and plot.
after this run   
```
ev.x
```
By giving input of Volume/Lattice parameter unit in Ang (according to data).  
Type of bravais lattice, if volume is taken give input as 'non-cubic' if not then 'fcc'.  
Eq of input is 4 munaghan eq of state.  

This will generate test.dat file where we can find the Bulk Modulus of Silicon.
